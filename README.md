# OpenGufeng: A melody and chord progression dataset for Chinese Gufeng Music
Gufeng music, a subgenre of Chinese pop music, borrows yet differs from traditional Chinese folk music with modern song structures, alongside rock and electronic dance music-based arrangements and pop music chord structures. Its commercial success is evident in the numerous chart-topping hits produced in this genre. However, a notable gap of symbolic datasets for Gufeng music has been impeding research progress in this field. This paper aims to address this deficiency by introducing "OpenGufeng," a symbolic dataset designed for Gufeng music. This dataset has four different tempo settings of continuous play, providing melody and corresponding chords in a single key. We aim for "OpenGufeng" to be a valuable resource for research in music information retrieval within the Gufeng music domain, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of this distinct musical style.

## Dataset
See `Raw MIDI Files` for recorded melody and chord progressions. 

## To-do
- [ ] Melody cleanup: cleanup melody to monophonic and quantize to 16th note grid.
- [ ] Chord cleanup: cleanup chords to major or minor triads; dump them to a separate CSV files using alternative notation than MIDI.
